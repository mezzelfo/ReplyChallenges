Hi Luigino, this is the alpha version of the app.
I had to build it quickly since... You know what is going on!
The app should work fine but probably some stuff is missing here and there.
I tested the build against the standard emulator with 6.0. 
In case it doesn't work properly I'm sure you will know what you have to do.
Don't worry, I added few things so no one can use the app except us.

Take care Luigino.
See you soon <3
